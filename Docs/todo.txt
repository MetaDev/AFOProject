use script  read out (average) strain on random locations (areas) of the mesh

create git

apply random forces on cube 

add noise to cube edges

test the data extraction by visualising it next to the model

run freecad script outside of freecad and with other libraries  (Anaconda Python IDE)

user proper mesh (simplified) for afo

how to simulate stress applied by force from another object in freecad?

add forces from opensim biomechanics

simulate the sensor grid starting from a flat surface, curving it into a mesh, ginving initial stretch data and realistic positioning



extra: 
from forum->test freecad build to sample selected data points
