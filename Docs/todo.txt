add noise to femmesh

create scene where one object displaces the other use contact constraints
use a shell

improve sampling of strains

#data realism
#TODO first we assume a fixed random sensor
#the next step would be to generalize to multiple sensors
the step afterwards is to reduce the 3D strain to 1D according to an (random?) axis on the surface of the mesh


test the data extraction by visualising it next to the model

run freecad script outside of freecad and with other libraries  (Anaconda Python IDE)

user proper mesh (simplified) for afo

how to simulate stress applied by force from another object in freecad?

add forces from opensim biomechanics

simulate the sensor grid starting from a flat surface, curving it into a mesh, ginving initial stretch data and realistic positioning



extra: 
from forum->test freecad build to sample selected data points
