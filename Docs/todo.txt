optimize data sampling for min distance between vector points
->requires position of points in data and maybe even poisson sampling http://www.alecjacobson.com/weblog/?p=4111

try importing new AFO's, this requires the newest version of SW to export to an opensource format (stp)

find out why prediction on ellips doesn't work

find out how to use rotations

find how to run freecad in background https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Start_up_and_Configuration

port to ubuntu (freecad plus tensorflow)

What to do with the fact that all strain info is in the fixed nodes, their position is not uniformly random
but any value not on the nodes would be an interpolation between nodes, the amount of information does not change
allow simulated strain gauge to be over multiple triangles


#data realism

extend displacment with 3D rotations


# train on data from many different sensor positions-> test by choosing random sensors and check whether data is retrieved
-> not necessary because a machine will be used to set certain displacement and generate realistic data from the unknown placed sensors


user proper mesh (simplified) for afo -> cannot build femmesh from this errors in opensim

add noise to femmesh and sensor data

forces in different directions instead of displacements
Use the Draft WB to draw a line. This line can then be used as a direction vector.

how to simulate stress applied by force from another object in freecad?
->create scene where one object displaces the other use contact constraints
use a shell
->contact constraint in fem workbench

add forces from opensim biomechanics
