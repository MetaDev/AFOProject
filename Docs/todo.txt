the step afterwards is to reduce the 3D strain to 1D according to an (random?) axis on the surface of the mesh (input) -> test by visualising
visualise the position of the "rekstokses" generated by the code for debug and feedback


make the displacment more complex, 3D, afterwards add rotations or torque

reintroduce random positions on the mesh with interpolation of strain vectors

only select nodes not on edges for strain calculation, either interpolate points again or increase node count in femmesh

forces in different directions
Use the Draft WB to draw a line. This line can then be used as a direction vector.


#data realism

generalisation of the modle would b to let it preform on unseen angles

# train on data from many different sensor positions-> test by choosing random sensors and check whether data is retrieved
-> not necessary because a machine will be used to set certain displacement and generate realistic data from the unknown placed sensors

test the data extraction by visualising it onto the mesh in freecad


user proper mesh (simplified) for afo -> cannot build femmesh from this errors in opensim

add noise to femmesh and sensor data

how to simulate stress applied by force from another object in freecad?

create scene where one object displaces the other use contact constraints
use a shell

add forces from opensim biomechanics
