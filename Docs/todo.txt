in data prepocessing, select random n_sensor vectors instead of first n

find out how to rename components in freecad, the name of the label cannot be used after change in the code App.Activedocument

find out how to use rotations

find how to run freecad in background https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Start_up_and_Configuration

port to ubuntu

allow simulated strain gauge to be over multiple triangles

reintroduce random positions on the mesh with interpolation of strain vectors



#data realism

extend displacment with 3D rotations


# train on data from many different sensor positions-> test by choosing random sensors and check whether data is retrieved
-> not necessary because a machine will be used to set certain displacement and generate realistic data from the unknown placed sensors


user proper mesh (simplified) for afo -> cannot build femmesh from this errors in opensim

add noise to femmesh and sensor data

forces in different directions instead of displacements
Use the Draft WB to draw a line. This line can then be used as a direction vector.

how to simulate stress applied by force from another object in freecad?
->create scene where one object displaces the other use contact constraints
use a shell
->contact constraint in fem workbench

add forces from opensim biomechanics
