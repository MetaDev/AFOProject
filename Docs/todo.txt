reintroduce random positions on the mesh with interpolation of strain vectors

make a mutli


forces in different directions instead of displacements
Use the Draft WB to draw a line. This line can then be used as a direction vector.


#data realism

extend displacment with 3D rotations

generalisation of the modle would b to let it preform on unseen angles

# train on data from many different sensor positions-> test by choosing random sensors and check whether data is retrieved
-> not necessary because a machine will be used to set certain displacement and generate realistic data from the unknown placed sensors

test the data extraction by visualising it onto the mesh in freecad
visualise the position of the "rekstokses" and the projected strain vectors on it generated by the code for debug and feedback
-> not really clear how I would visualise this 


user proper mesh (simplified) for afo -> cannot build femmesh from this errors in opensim

add noise to femmesh and sensor data

how to simulate stress applied by force from another object in freecad?
->create scene where one object displaces the other use contact constraints
use a shell

add forces from opensim biomechanics
