simulate influence of AFO on movement 
-> possible if parameteres used in AFO simulation of Opensim are available for physical AFO

Is there data available of AFO stress during movement?


following: https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Import_from_STL_or_OBJ
I can create a shape seemingly without holes, but still the FEM in FreeCAD "hangs" (could be due to complexity of shape) but after 10 min no result
A mesh created withing freecad does work
-> I create a simple shape and continue from there

What assumptions can I make about the network sensors?
Do I know the distribution on the surface, the information of neighbour sensors?
