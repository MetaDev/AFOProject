in https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=20801 there is a branch for freecad where the stress at a point is calculated

script to deform meshes: https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Scripted_objects


research previous work on machine learning for extraction forces from stress sensor: https://www.ipr.kit.edu/english/315_603.php

if FEM in freecad is too slow, there is an alternative: http://sfepy.org/doc-devel/preprocessing.html

min/max/med principal stress is representative for all stress in an element (max shear and von mises stress are derived from them)

documentation for FEM results : https://www.freecadweb.org/api/d3/d81/classFem_1_1FemResultObject.html
