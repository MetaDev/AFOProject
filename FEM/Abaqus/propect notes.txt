Abaqus project notes

lookup simulation on a stent

first crimping with other object (contact)
than recoil -> hyperelastic
than expansion in the vessel simulate the vessel

first draw stent

mesh sensitivity analysis

add nodes to more curved parts

hyperelastic material, expansion with recoil ( find parameters in literature)

first compare three materials 
than play with parameters
