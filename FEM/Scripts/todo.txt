idea to keep in mind: the ae is used to impute data, the more it understands the underlying structure
of the data, generalizes, the better it will work

fix data relevance visualisation

continu tutorial tensorflow



get some more realistic data from VIGO

do some refactoring by using some keras code: https://blog.keras.io/keras-as-a-simplified-interface-to-tensorflow-tutorial.html
and add some more advanced features like dropout and early stopping

train ae on different types of missing data
training same network on different permutations of missing sensors
-> dropout

use 3D autoencoder

fix rotation prediction, should be possible when data available vigo

find relevant sensors
2. -> use gradient for multivariate importance in neural net
