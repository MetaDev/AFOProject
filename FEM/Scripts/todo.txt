idea to keep in mind: the ae is used to impute data, the more it understands the underlying structure
of the data, generalizes, the better it will work

to better compare ae vs non ae approach test different ratios of number of sensors and find maybe some where
it performs better with the encoder

do some refactoring by using some keras code: https://blog.keras.io/keras-as-a-simplified-interface-to-tensorflow-tutorial.html

use 3D autoencoder

fix rotation prediction, different position of sensors (brute force?)
