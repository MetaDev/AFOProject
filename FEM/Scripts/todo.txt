idea to keep in mind: the ae is used to impute data, the more it understands the underlying structure
of the data, generalizes, the better it will work

wait for new abaqus data for transfer learning of model
ask for rotation data vigo

check running of visualise angle accuracy

continu tutorial tensorflow

ask for abaqus on HPC



for strain impute:
do some refactoring by using some keras code: https://blog.keras.io/keras-as-a-simplified-interface-to-tensorflow-tutorial.html
and add some more advanced features like dropout and early stopping

train ae on different types of missing data
training same network on different permutations of missing sensors
-> dropout

use 3D autoencoder
