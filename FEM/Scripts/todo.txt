idea to keep in mind: the ae is used to impute data, the more it understands the underlying structure
of the data, generalizes, the better it will work

find relevant sensors
2. -> use gradient for multivariate importance in neural net
!!currently visulisation is not very useful because most information is in the largest deformed parts
which are the wings of the defrmation


do some refactoring by using some keras code: https://blog.keras.io/keras-as-a-simplified-interface-to-tensorflow-tutorial.html
and add some more advanced features like dropout and early stopping

train ae on different types of missing data
training same network on different permutations of missing sensors
-> dropout

use 3D autoencoder

fix rotation prediction, different position of sensors (brute force?)
