idea to keep in mind: the ae is used to impute data, the more it understands the underlying structure
of the data, generalizes, the better it will work

transfer learning between different sensor positions

test with interpolation-> noisy position required?
user kernel methods (GP) with set kernels (no position requried) fixed amount
http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~jebara/papers/Kondor,Jebara_point_set.pdf

the sensor can be identified and thus have a fixed order during use but not between differen layouts

test with RNN, when more data is available, back to freecad?
I can get many freecad fem models from the forum
use graph kernel, 3D conv


for strain impute:
do some refactoring by using some keras code: https://blog.keras.io/keras-as-a-simplified-interface-to-tensorflow-tutorial.html
and add some more advanced features like dropout and early stopping

train ae on different types of missing data
training same network on different permutations of missing sensors
-> dropout

use 3D autoencoder
